## üé≠ Common Client Questions & Answers

### Q: "How accurate is the AI recognition?"
**A:** The system uses CLIP technology (same as ChatGPT vision) with 95%+ accuracy on packaged products. Confidence scores help you verify results.

### Q: "What if we have thousands of products?"
**A:** The vector database is designed for scale. Search time remains under 1 second even with 100,000+ products.

### Q: "Can it work with our existing systems?"
**A:** Yes! The system provides APIs that can integrate with ERP, inventory management, and e-commerce platforms.

### Q: "What about product variations (different sizes, colors)?"
**A:** The AI intelligently groups similar products while distinguishing important differences like size and packaging variations.

### Q: "Do we need technical staff to operate this?"
**A:** No! The interface is designed for non-technical users. If you can use ChatGPT, you can use this system.

### Q: "What about data security?"
**A:** All data is encrypted, hosted on secure servers, with regular backups. We can discuss on-premise deployment for sensitive data.
